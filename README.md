# SkyBetTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.

## Why Angular?

Angular is a pretty self sufficient framework that has most of the capabilities that we'll need in an App like this.

It has things like `WebSocketSubject` which I used as the WebSocket Client.

Angular supports `TypeScript` out of the box and it definitely comes in really handy when working on complex applications like these.

Angular has a better separation of concerns throughout, from Angular Modules to a Component having separate files for markup, styles, and logic.

Finally, I've been using Angular for quite some time now and I was at ease with Angular.

## Running the Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
